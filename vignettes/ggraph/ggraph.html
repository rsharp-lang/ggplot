<p>ggraph is an extension of ggplot2 aimed at supporting relational <br />
 data structures such as networks, graphs, and trees. While it <br />
 builds upon the foundation of ggplot2 and its API it comes with <br />
 its own self-contained set of geoms, facets, etc., as well as <br />
 adding the concept of layouts to the grammar.</p></p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em;"><h3>The core concepts</h3>

<p>ggraph builds upon three core concepts that are quite easy To <br />
 understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Layout defines how nodes are placed On the plot, that Is, <br />
it Is a conversion Of the relational Structure into an x And <br />
y value For Each node In the graph. ggraph has access To all <br />
layout functions available In igraph And furthermore provides <br />
a large selection Of its own, such As hive plots, treemaps, <br />
And circle packing.</li>
<li>The Nodes are the connected entities In the relational Structure. <br />
These can be plotted Using the geom_node_*() family Of geoms. <br />
Some node geoms make more sense For certain layouts, e.g. <br />
geom_node_tile() For treemaps And icicle plots, While others <br />
are more general purpose, e.g. geom_node_point().</li>
<li>The Edges are the connections between the entities In the <br />
relational Structure. These can be visualized Using the <br />
geom_edge_*() family Of geoms that contain a lot Of different <br />
edge types For different scenarios. Sometimes the edges are implied <br />
by the layout (e.g. With treemaps) And need Not be plotted, <br />
but often some sort Of line Is warranted.</li>
</ul></p>
